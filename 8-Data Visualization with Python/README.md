# Data Visualization with Python
This course will teach you to work with many Data Visualization tools and techniques. You will learn to create various types of basic and advanced graphs and charts like: Waffle Charts, Area Plots, Histograms, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Scatter Plots, Word Clouds, Choropleth Maps, and many more! You will also create interactive dashboards that allow even those without any Data Science experience to better understand data, and make more effective and informed decisions.   

You will learn hands-on by completing numerous labs and a final project to practice and apply the many aspects and techniques of Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebooks and a Cloud-based IDE. You will use several data visualization libraries in Python, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & Dash.

## What you'll learn:
1. Implement data visualization techniques and plots using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to tell a stimulating story
2. Create different types of charts and plots such as line, area, histograms, bar, pie, box, scatter, and bubble
3. Create advanced visualizations such as waffle charts, word clouds, regression plots, maps with markers, & choropleth maps
4. Generate interactive dashboards containing scatter, line, bar, bubble, pie, and sunburst charts using the Dash framework and Plotly library

## Skills Gained:
- Dashboards and Charts
- dash
- Python Programming
- Matplotlib
- Data Visualization (DataViz)
